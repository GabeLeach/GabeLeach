# Welcome to my GitHub 👋

I'm a PhD Candidate working on AI and sensor-based health monitoring. Most of my work involves building tools to analyse data for assessing age related conditions, posture, and activity, with a strong focus on reproducibility, modularity, and real-world application.

---

## What I’m working on

At the moment, I’m developing:

- Machine learning pipelines for classifying different postures
- apps with good GUI's to make model training, evaluation, and visualisation more intuitive
- Tools for aligning, cleaning, and engineering features from sensor devices
- Evaluation methods like Leave-One-Study-Out and cross-participant generalisation

The goal is to make it easier for stakeholders; end-users, researchers, and clinicians to work with complex sensor data, and to bridge the gap between raw signals and interpretable results.

## Research & technical focus

- 🧠 Human activity recognition from sensor data
- 📊 Pressure and IMU data fusion
- ⚙️ Scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Streamlit, TensorFlow & Keras (for deep learning)
- 📦 Docker, Git, Django, React (for UI tooling)
- 📈 Reproducibility, evaluation, and model explainability

---

## Beyond the PhD

Outside of research, I’m interested in:
- Financial modelling and algorithmic trading (currently exploring this as a potential post-PhD direction)
- Creative tech projects — from interactive games and simulations to random optimisation tools and experiments.
- I enjoy playing video games, I tend to lean more towards traditional RPG's that emphasise story and strategy. I enjoy mechanics that reward knowledge, preperationm and careful build optimisation. 

Some projects here are practical, some are academic, and some are just for fun.

### Life beyond the screen
When I’m not at my desk, I’m probably:
- Running around at a LARP event
- Playing rugby (badly, but enthusiastically)
- Catching up with building and painting my Warhammer army

## Contact

I’m always happy to talk about:
- Collaborating on applied ML and sensing projects
- Building better research tools
- Making cool, weird, or useful stuff with code

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore my repos or drop me a message.

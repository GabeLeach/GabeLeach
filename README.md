### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!

👋🏽 Hi, my name is Gabe. Here you will find a collection of my personal projects, CodeWars solutions and portfolio work.

🎓 I recently graduated from MSci Computer Science with AI (Hons), at the University of Nottingham.

🌇 UK based, passionate and aspiring Computer Scientist. 

📚 My main interests are within the development of technology that provides excellent user experience and interactivity. Specifically, the implementation of natural language processing and intelligent agents to create tailored solutions accommodating a wide range of user requirements.

💻 As for my future, I would like to continue research into the application of mixed reality technologies and the social impact they could have on user experience. Over the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have sought out ways to stay in contact with friends and family remotely. Perhaps MR could be a new development in how we socialise as humans.

🏔 In my free time, I enjoy playing a bit of Rugby League and taking part in Hackathons. Oh, and I LOVE Thai food.

💪🏽 My strengths include; Software Development, Natural Language Processing, Programming, Event Organisation and Communication.
